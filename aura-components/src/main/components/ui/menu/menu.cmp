    Menu Accessibility rules:

    Opening the menu:
     * users can tab onto the menu trigger and should see the focus state
     * pressing space opens the menu
     * users can also use their mouse to hover over the menu trigger (hover state is triggered)
     * clicking on the menu trigger opens the menu

    Selecting a menu item:
     * initially no item in the menu is highlighted
     * once the menu is open users can arrow down/right through the menu options
     * arrowing through the menu options is a loop in both directions
     * items highlighted through arrowing display the same styling as the hover state
     * pressing (return) selects the highlighted item
     * arrowing to an item that is out of view because of scroll should be scrolled into view
     * users can also hover over a menu item, and it will show it's hover state
     * users can select the item by clicking
     * while clicking on an item, the menu item should show the active state
     * disabled items share the highlighting behavior of normal menu items but do not have an active state and
       cannot be triggered by either pressing return or clicking.
     * clicking anywhere in the row area (even if not occupied by menu item text) selects the menu item
     * label items in the menu can not be highlighted but should still be readable by screenreaders

    Exiting the menu:
     * users can press esc to close the menu without selecting an item, focus is returned to the menu trigger
     * users can click outside the menu area to close the menu without selecting an item
     * pressing tab while the menu is open closes the menu and moves the focus to the next focusable element on the page
     * pressing shift-tab while the menu is open closes the menu and moves the focus to the previous focusable element on the page
